# MAGIC #### DQ Dashboard — View Setup
# MAGIC Run once per environment (dev, then again for uat/prod once they exist),
# MAGIC same as `03_event_log_setup.py`. Creates the 3 views backing the DQ dashboard,
# MAGIC scoped to the given `catalog` — a fresh, correctly-qualified set of views per
# MAGIC environment, not one view trying to dynamically switch catalogs at query time.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Requires `03_event_log_setup.py` to have already been run for this catalog.

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.widgets.text("catalog", "dev", "Target catalog")
catalog = dbutils.widgets.get("catalog")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ####Expectations, Bronze and Silver, unified
# MAGIC Same query shape covers both layers — expectations are expectations, regardless
# MAGIC of which pipeline wrote them.
